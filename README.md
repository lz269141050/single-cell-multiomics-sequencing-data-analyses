# single-cell multiomics

This is a pipeline for single-cell multiomics sequencing data analyses.
Using single-cell multiomics, the study examines DNA methylation, regulome, and transcriptome profiles of ILCPs, revealing distinct stages and heterogeneity in ILCP methylation that drive ILC lineage differentiation.
Manuscript is under review.
